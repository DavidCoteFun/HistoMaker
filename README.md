# HistoMaker
Data analysis package developed during my Ph.D. to analyze particle collisions produced by the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. It was originally developed together with the `BaBarDataPreparation` package, but it can also be used standalone.

# To compile
```source comp_HistoMaker```

# To execute:
```HistoMakerUser/main.cpp < options >```
